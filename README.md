# xkill_windows
 A python programm to replicate linux' xkill command.


## Installation
 Sadly I can't make it into a .exe, so you'll have to have python for it.

 You can just run the script from the command line, or if you want to add it as a command to the terminal create a .bat file with the following content:
 ```bash
 @python3 path/to/file/xkill.py
 ```
 save as xkill.bat and put it into your ```C:\Windows\System32\``` folder so it will be recognized as a command.
